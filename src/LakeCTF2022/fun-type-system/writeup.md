# Fun type system

To get if off my chest, I'll start by answering the question proposed by the title.
The answer is no. Fuck type systems, from now on I'm only using Lua or Python.

Now let's review this fun challenge which took me 9 hours to still fail `:)`

## The challenge
> Just make the program compile! It shouldn't be that hard...
>
> [README.md](TODO)
>
> [Main.scala](TODO)
>
> [build.sbt](TODO)
>
> [build.properties](TODO)

## How to solve the challenge
We're given a couple of build files, some instructions, and a `Main.scala` file
which contains the main part of the challenge. Its contents show a mix of 
short CTF, pop culture and almost biblical references disguised as types in a
regular Scala file.

Our first step will be to make sense out of these names and try to understand
just what is going on
